# Blackjack

## Proposal

I am going to attempt to create a simple **Blackjack** application which will function very similar to playing Blackjack
at a casino. There will be a Player who will be able to buy in to the game and play against the Dealer. The Player can
place a bet before both the Player and the Dealer have been dealt their cards, and if the total value of the Player's
hand is greater than the Dealer's hand, then the Player wins double their bet. If the Player has been dealt a hand
with total value of 21, then that hand will be declared a *Blackjack*, and the Player will receive 2.5 times their
initial bet. In the case where the Player's hand has a smaller value than the Dealer's hand, the Player will lose the
money that they have bet on their hand. This game will occur in a cycle until either the Player chooses to leave and
cash out, or the Player goes bankrupt.\
I want to make this app for anyone and everyone to use as a source of entertainment. I am interested in this project
because I like to play Blackjack for fun with my friends online, so I thought it would be a really interesting to try 
to create the game myself as my first personal project in Java.

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
